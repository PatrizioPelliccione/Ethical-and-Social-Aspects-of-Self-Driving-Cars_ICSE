abstract = "Abstract The automotive domain is living an extremely challenging historical moment shocked by many emerging business and technological needs. Electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars are some of the driving needs in this changing world. Increasingly, vehicles are becoming software-intensive complex systems and most of the innovation within the automotive industry is based on electronics and software. Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through several networks within the car, and the car is increasingly connected with the outside world. These novelties ask for a change on how the software is engineered and produced and for a disruptive renovation of the electrical and software architecture of the car. In this paper we describe the current investigation of Volvo Cars to create an architecture framework able to cope with the complexity and needs of present and future vehicles. Specifically, we present scenarios that describe demands for the architectural framework and introduce three new viewpoints that need to be taken into account for future architectural decisions: Continuous Integration and Deployment, Ecosystem and Transparency, and car as a constituent of a System of Systems. Our results are based on a series of focus groups with experts in automotive engineering and architecture from different companies and universities."

    abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are being viewed with scepticism in their ability to improve safety and the driving experience. A critical issue with automated driving at this stage of its development is that it is not yet reliable and safe. When automated driving fails, or is limited, the autonomous mode disengages and the drivers are expected to resume manual driving. For this transition to occur safely, it is imperative that drivers react in an appropriate and timely manner. Recent data released from the California trials provide compelling insights into the current factors influencing disengagements of autonomous mode. Here we show that the number of accidents observed has a significantly high correlation with the autonomous miles travelled. The reaction times to take control of the vehicle in the event of a disengagement was found to have a stable distribution across different companies at 0.83 seconds on average. However, there were differences observed in reaction times based on the type of disengagements, type of roadway and autonomous miles travelled. Lack of trust caused by the exposure to automated disengagements was found to increase the likelihood to take control of the vehicle manually. Further, with increased vehicle miles travelled the reaction times were found to increase, which suggests an increased level of trust with more vehicle miles travelled. We believe that this research would provide insurers, planners, traffic management officials and engineers fundamental insights into trust and reaction times that would help them design and engineer their systems.},

@article{Waldrop2015,
abstract = {A world of driverless cars Illustration by Don Foley; text by M. Mitchell Waldrop; design by Kelly Krause/Nature 1 Fully autonomous vehicles are developing faster than anyone would have thought a few years ago, with many experts predicting that they will become widely available in the next 5–10 years. Many questions remain, but it is already possible to imagine how this new world of driverless cars will work. Location Mapping software uses Global Positioning System data to tell the car where it is in relation to roads, traffic signals, and other landmarks. Route planning An on-board computer uses sensor data to plot a route that gets the car where it needs to go, while avoiding people, potholes and other vehicles. Perception Vehicles use radar to detect obstacles, a laser ranging system to map the surroundings in three dimensions, and video cameras to identify objects such as traffic lights, construction signs, pedestrians and other vehicles. Communication Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) radios send signals between cars, trucks and infrastructure items such as traffic lights. Road trains Vehicles can take advantage of aerodynamics and save fuel by following one another almost bumper to bumper. They are protected from catastrophic pile-ups by their V2V radios, which allow all the cars in line to hit their brakes at the same time. Decision and action To make the appropriate responses to rare events — such as a ball bouncing in from a playground, or a plastic bag blowing down the roadway — the cars rely on algorithms refined through millions of kilometres of test drives. Adaptive traffic flow Smart infrastructure integrates V2V signals from the moving cars to optimize speed limits, traffic-light timing and the number of lanes in each direction on the basis of the actual traffic load. The result is a smoother flow, shorter travel time and less energy wasted at traffic lights or in traffic jams. Mass transport People increasingly give up owning cars in favour of calling companies to pick them up wherever they are and drop them off wherever they need to go — a driverless version of a ride-sharing service. Cities transformed Urban centres begin to undo the many accommodations they have made for personal vehicles — starting with the vast quantities of real estate devoted to parking, which could be adapted to more productive uses.

Had a human been at the wheel, the death would have been considered an accident because the pedestrian was clearly at fault and no reasonable person could have swerved in time. But the "reasonable person" legal standard for driver negligence disappeared back in the 2020s, when the proliferation of driverless cars reduced crash rates by 90 percent. Now the standard is that of the reasonable robot. The victim's family sues the vehicle manufacturer on that ground, claiming that, although the car didn't have time to brake, it could have swerved around the pedestrian, crossing the double yellow line and colliding with the empty driverless vehicle in the next lane. A reconstruction of the crash using data from the vehicle's own sensors confirms this. The plaintiff's attorney, deposing the car's lead software designer, asks: "Why didn't the car swerve?"},

abstract = "Abstract How safe are autonomous vehicles? The answer is critical for determining how autonomous vehicles may shape motor vehicle safety and public health, and for developing sound policies to govern their deployment. One proposed way to assess safety is to test drive autonomous vehicles in real traffic, observe their performance, and make statistical comparisons to human driver performance. This approach is logical, but it is practical? In this paper, we calculate the number of miles of driving that would be needed to provide clear statistical evidence of autonomous vehicle safety. Given that current traffic fatalities and injuries are rare events compared to vehicle miles traveled, we show that fully autonomous vehicles would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries. Under even aggressive testing assumptions, existing fleets would take tens and sometimes hundreds of years to drive these miles—an impossible proposition if the aim is to demonstrate their performance prior to releasing them on the roads for consumer use. These findings demonstrate that developers of this technology and third-party testers cannot simply drive their way to safety. Instead, they will need to develop innovative methods of demonstrating safety and reliability. And yet, the possibility remains that it will not be possible to establish with certainty the safety of autonomous vehicles. Uncertainty will remain. Therefore, it is imperative that autonomous vehicle regulations are adaptive—designed from the outset to evolve with the technology so that society can better harness the benefits and manage the risks of these rapidly evolving and potentially transformative technologies."

abstract={The growing complexity of software employed in the cyber-physical domain is calling for a thorough study of both its functional and extra-functional properties. Ethical aspects are among important extra-functional properties, that cover the whole life cycle with different stages from design, development, deployment/production to use of cyber physical systems. One of the ethical challenges involved is the question of identifying the responsibilities of each stakeholder associated with the development and use of a cyber-physical system. This challenge is made even more pressing by the introduction of autonomous increasingly intelligent systems that can perform functionalities without human intervention, because of the lack of experience, best practices and policies for such technology. In this article, we provide a framework for responsibility attribution based on the amount of autonomy and automation involved in AI based cyber-physical systems. Our approach enables traceability of anomalous behaviors back to the responsible agents, be they human or software, allowing us to identify and separate the "responsibility" of the decision-making software from human responsibility. This provides us with a framework to accommodate the ethical "responsibility" of the software for AI based cyber-physical systems that will be deployed in the future, underscoring the role of ethics as an important extra-functional property. Finally, this systematic approach makes apparent the need for rigorous communication protocols between different actors associated with the development and operation of cyber-physical systems that further identifies the ethical challenges involved in the form of group responsibilities.},

As the digital era increasingly reaches deeper into transportation, our task at the U.S. Department of Transportation is not only to keep pace, but to ensure public safety while establishing a strong foundation such that the rules of the road can be known, understood, and responded to by industry and the public. The self-driving car raises more possibilities and more questions than perhaps any other transportation innovation under present discussion. That is as it should be. Possessing the potential to uproot personal mobility as we know it, to make it safer and even more ubiquitous than conventional automobiles and perhaps even more efficient, self-driving cars have become the archetype of our future transportation. Still, important concerns emerge. Will they fully replace the human driver? What ethical judgments will they be called upon to make? What socioeconomic impacts flow from such a dramatic change? Will they disrupt the nature of privacy and security?

Many of these larger questions will require longer and more thorough dialogue with government, industry, academia and, most importantly, the public. },

An autonomous system cannot be an exception. Inevitably an autonomous system will find itself in a situation in which it needs to not only choose to obey a rule or not, but also make a complex ethical decision. However, there exists no obvious way to implement the human understanding of ethical behaviour in computers. Even if we enable autonomous systems to distinguish between more and less ethical alternatives, how can we be sure that they would choose right? We consider autonomous systems with a hybrid architecture in which the highest level of reasoning is executed by a rational (BDI) agent. For such a system, formal verification has been used successfully to prove that specific rules of behaviour are observed when making decisions. We propose a theoretical framework for ethical plan selection that can be formally verified. We implement a rational agent that incorporates a given ethical policy in its plan selection and show that we can formally verify that the agent chooses to execute, to the best of its beliefs, the most ethical available plan."

abstract = {Head of Google's self-driving technology When I rst learned to drive, every mile I spent on the road was crucial. It was only through practice that I learned how to move with the ow of trac, anticipate people's behavior, and react to unexpected situations. Developing a truly self-driving car is no dierent. A self-driving car that can get you safely from door to door has to understand the nuances of the road, which only comes with experience. That's why our team has been focused on gaining real-world experience, and this month, we've reached a major milestone: we've now driven more than 2 million fully-autonomous miles on public roads. Put another way, if you consider the hours we've spent on the road, our cars now have the equivalent of 300 years of human driving experience. What takes a self-driving car from concept, to demonstration, and nally to reality is this accumulated experience. Even in the early days of our project, it didn't take long before we could give a good demo ride in our self-driving car. That's because it's relatively easy to master the rst 90{\%} of driving where you're traveling on freeways, navigating light city-street trac, or making your way through simple intersections. But to create a truly self-driving car that can do all the driving, we knew we'd need experience in more challenging and interesting situations. That's why we now spend the vast majority of our time on complex city streets, rather than simpler environments like highways. It takes much more time to accumulate miles if you're focused on suburban roads; still, we're gaining experience at a rapid pace: our rst million miles took six years to drive, but our next million took just 16 months. Today, we're taking a look at how our last million miles has brought us closer to making a truly self-driving car a reality. ++++++ We've taught our cars a collection of advanced driving skills. In the last few years, we've been focusing on the harder tasks of driving — the nal 10{\%} — that take much more time and experience to master. Our cars have gotten much better at detecting and responding to everything from crossing guards to emergency vehicles to construction zones. With these advanced driving skills, we can adjust to things like sudden changes in road conditions, such as closed lanes. The ability to navigate smoothly on the road, while subtle, is also an important advanced driving skill that helps people feel comfortable whether they're inside or outside of the car. With each mile we drive, our test drivers provide feedback on the car's movements — things like how quickly we accelerate and brake, the distance we keep from other cars and pedestrians, or the speed and angle we turn. With each piece of feedback, our engineers tweak our software and calibrate our driving behavior, making our self-driving car feel more natural on the road. We have a better understanding of the social side of driving. Ultimately, being a good driver is about understanding other people — pedestrians, bikers and fellow drivers. Over the last year, we've learned that being a good driver is more than just knowing how to safely navigating around people, but also knowing how to interact with them.},

abstract={Decision process is often based on multi-faceted and mutually opposing criteria. In order to provide rigorous techniques for problem structuring and criteria aggregation used for classification and ranking of alternatives, Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been used as a method to achieve architectural decisions. Even though it has already been argued in literature that MCDA essentially depends on value systems of decision-makers, it is a question how the decision result reflects a particular criterion, requirement or a particular decision. This is especially true if a criterion is not precisely specified. In this paper we analyse the ethical aspects of MCDA. In our analysis we argue that it is in the long run necessary to make value basis of decision-making and ethical considerations explicit and subject for scrutiny. As a support to encourage introduction of transparent value-based deliberation we propose an extended MCDA scheme that would explicitly take into account ethical analysis. As an illustration, we present an industrial case study for the Software (SW)/Hardware (HW) partitioning of a wind turbine application in which different decisions can be taken, depending on the ethical aspects.},

It mounts on top of a vehicle, has 64 lasers that generate millions of data points per second, and is a potential game changer in the world of autonomous vehicle  technology.

The HDL-64E LiDAR sensor from Morgan Hill, Calif.-based Velodyne is designed for obstacle detection and navigation of autonomous ground vehicles and marine vessels. Its durability, 360-degree field of view and high data-collection rate makes this sensor ideal for the most demanding real-world perception applications, as well as for effective 3-D mobile data collection and mapping applications.

Velodyne's LiDAR system is the brainchild of  visionary entrepreneur and company founder David Hall, who also holds numerous patents in the field of digital audio amplification—he built his first amplifier at the age of four.

Entering the Race

Velodyne's expertise with laser distance measurement began by participating in the 2005 Grand Challenge sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). A race for autonomous vehicles across theMojave desert, DARPA's goal was to stimulate autonomous vehicle technology development for both military and commercial applications.

Hall and his brother Bruce entered the competition as Team DAD (Digital Audio Drive). The team initially developed its technology for visualizing the environment with a dual video camera approach, and later developed a laser-based system that became the foundation for Velodyne's current LiDAR products.

The first Velodyne LIDAR scanner was about 30 inches in diameter and weighed close to 100 pounds. By focusing on commercializing the LiDAR scanner, Velodyne dramatically reduced the sensor's size and weight while improving its performance.

To date, one of the most newsworthy efforts involving theHDL-64E LiDAR sensor has been its use as an integral component of Google's experimental fleet of self-driving Toyota Priuses, which reportedly now have logged more than 190,000 miles. Stanford University professor Sebastian Thrun, who guides the project along with Google engineer Chris Urmson, describes Velodyne's LiDAR as “the heart of the system.”

The Google vehicles also carry other sensors, including four radars, mounted on the front and rear bumpers that allow the car to “see” far enough to deal with fast traffic on freeways; a camera, positioned near the rear-view mirror, that detects traffic lights; and a Global Positioning System inertial measurement unit and wheel encoder that work together to determine the vehicle's location and keep track of its movements.

According to The New York Times, Google touts safety as one of the top reasons to bring autonomous vehicles to the road.  With instant reaction time and 360-degree awareness, engineers believe these autonomous autos have the potential to significantly decrease highway-related deaths and accidents. Unlike human drivers, LiDAR doesn't get tired, become distracted or fall asleep at the wheel.

You may one day get the opportunity to read the paper, eat breakfast, pay a few bills and e-mail your college roommate during your morning commute—all with LiDAR-assisted driving.},

title={Risk-Based Decision-Making Fallacies: Why Present Functional Safety Standards are Not Enough}, 
year={2017}, 
pages={153-160}, 
abstract={Functional safety of a system is the part of its overall safety that depends on the system operating correctly in response to its inputs. Safety is defined as the absence of unacceptable/unreasonable risk by functional safety standards, which enforce safety requirements in each phase of the development process of safety-critical software and hardware systems. Acceptability of risks is judged within a framework of analysis with contextual and cultural aspects by individuals who may introduce subjectivity and misconceptions in the assessment. While functional safety standards elaborate much on the avoidance of unreasonable risk in the development of safety-critical software and hardware systems, little is addressed on the issue of avoiding unreasonable judgments of risk. Through the studies of common fallacies in risk perception and ethics, we present a moral-psychological analysis of functional safety standards and propose plausible improvements of the involved risk-related decision making processes, with a focus on the notion of an acceptable residual risk. As a functional safety reference model, we use the functional safety standard ISO 26262, which addresses potential hazards caused by malfunctions of software and hardware systems within road vehicles and defines safety measures that are required to achieve an acceptable level of safety. The analysis points out the critical importance of a robust safety culture with developed countermeasures to the common fallacies in risk perception, which are not addressed by contemporary functional safety standards. We argue that functional safety standards should be complemented with the analysis of potential hazards caused by fallacies in risk perception, their countermeasures, and the requirement that residual risks must be explicated, motivated, and accompanied by a plan for their continuous reduction. This approach becomes especially important in contemporary developed autonomous vehicles with increasing computational con- rol by increasingly intelligent software applications.},

abstract="Among ethicists and engineers within robotics there is an ongoing discussion as to whether ethical robots are possible or even desirable. We answer both of these questions in the positive, based on an extensive literature study of existing arguments. Our contribution consists in bringing together and reinterpreting pieces of information from a variety of sources. One of the conclusions drawn is that artifactual morality must come in degrees and depend on the level of agency, autonomy and intelligence of the machine. Moral concerns for agents such as intelligent search machines are relatively simple, while highly intelligent and autonomous artifacts with significant impact and complex modes of agency must be equipped with more advanced ethical capabilities. Systems like cognitive robots are being developed that are expected to become part of our everyday lives in future decades. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that their behaviour is adequate. In an analogy with artificial intelligence, which is the ability of a machine to perform activities that would require intelligence in humans, artificial morality is considered to be the ability of a machine to perform activities that would require morality in humans. The capacity for artificial (artifactual) morality, such as artifactual agency, artifactual responsibility, artificial intentions, artificial (synthetic) emotions, etc., come in varying degrees and depend on the type of agent. As an illustration, we address the assurance of safety in modern High Reliability Organizations through responsibility distribution. In the same way that the concept of agency is generalized in the case of artificial agents, the concept of moral agency, including responsibility, is generalized too. We propose to look at artificial moral agents as having functional responsibilities within a network of distributed responsibilities in a socio-technological system. This does not take away the responsibilities of the other stakeholders in the system, but facilitates an understanding and regulation of such networks. It should be pointed out that the process of development must assume an evolutionary form with a number of iterations because the emergent properties of artifacts must be tested in real world situations with agents of increasing intelligence and moral competence. We see this paper as a contribution to the macro-level Requirement Engineering through discussion and analysis of general requirements for design of ethical robots.",

abstract = {This Recommended Practice provides a taxonomy for motor vehicle driving automation systems that perform part or all of the dynamic driving task (DDT) on a sustained basis and that range in level from no driving automation (level 0) to full driving automation (level 5). It provides detailed definitions for these six levels of driving automation in the context of motor vehicles (hereafter also referred to as “vehicle” or “vehicles”) and their operation on roadways. These level definitions, along with additional supporting terms and definitions provided herein, can be used to describe the full range of driving automation features equipped on motor vehicles in a functionally consistent and coherent manner. “On-road” refers to publicly accessible roadways (including parking areas and private campuses that permit public access) that collectively serve users of vehicles of all classes and driving automation levels (including no driving automation), as well as motorcyclists, pedal cyclists, and pedestrians.The levels apply to the driving automation feature(s) that are engaged in any given instance of on-road operation of an equipped vehicle. As such, although a given vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system that is capable of delivering multiple driving automation features that perform at different levels, the level of driving automation exhibited in any given instance is determined by the feature(s) that are engaged.This document also refers to three primary actors in driving: the (human) driver, the driving automation system, and other vehicle systems and components. These other vehicle systems (or the vehicle in general terms) do not include the driving automation system in this model, even though as a practical matter a driving automation system may actually share hardware and software components with other vehicle systems, such as a processing module(s) or operating code.The levels of driving automation are defined by reference to the specific role played by each of the three primary actors in performance of the DDT. “Role” in this context refers to the expected role of a given primary actor, based on the design of the driving automation system in question and not necessarily to the actual performance of a given primary actor. For example, a driver who fails to monitor the roadway during engagement of a level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) system still has the role of driver, even while s/he is neglecting it. Active safety systems, such as electronic stability control and automated emergency braking, and certain types of driver assistance systems, such as lane keeping assistance, are excluded from the scope of this driving automation taxonomy because they do not perform part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis and, rather, merely provide momentary intervention during potentially hazardous situations. Due to the momentary nature of the actions of active safety systems, their intervention does not change or eliminate the role of the driver in performing part or all of the DDT, and thus are not considered to be driving automation.It should, however, be noted that crash avoidance features, including intervention-type active safety systems, may be included in vehicles equipped with driving automation systems at any level. For ADS-equipped vehicles (i.e., levels 3-5) that perform the complete DDT, crash avoidance capability is part of ADS functionality.},

Defining the algorithms that will help AVs make these moral decisions is a formidable challenge. We found that participants in six Amazon Mechanical Turk studies approved of utilitarian AVs (that is, AVs that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good) and would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs that protect their passengers at all costs. The study participants disapprove of enforcing utilitarian regulations for AVs and would be less willing to buy such an AV. Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology.},

The radar was added to all Tesla vehicles in October 2014 as part of the Autopilot hardware suite, but was only meant to be a supplementary sensor to the primary camera and image processing system. After careful consideration, we now believe it can be used as a primary control sensor without requiring the camera to confirm visual image recognition. This is a non-trivial and counter-intuitive problem, because of how strange the world looks in radar. Photons of that wavelength travel easily through fog, dust, rain and snow, but anything metallic looks like a mirror. The radar can see people, but they appear partially translucent. Something made of wood or painted plastic, though opaque to a person, is almost as transparent as glass to radar.},

title="Self-driving Cars in Dilemmatic Situations: An Approach Based on the Theory of Justification in Criminal Law",
journal="Criminal Law and Philosophy",

day="05",
abstract="This article puts forward solutions to some of the ethical and legal dilemmas posed in the current discussion on how to program crash algorithms in autonomous or self-driving cars. The first part of the paper defines the scope of the problem in the criminal legal field, and the next section gives a critical analysis of the proposal to always prioritise the interest of the occupant of the vehicle in situations with conflict of interests. The principle of minimizing social damage as a model for configuring self-driving cars is examined in the third section. Despite its apparent plausibility, within the framework of a liberal legal system that recognises humans as free agents who have rights and responsibilities, maximizing the function of social utility does not justify harmful interference into a person's legal sphere. Therefore, in the fourth part, the author argues the need to program the crash algorithms of autonomous cars based on a deontological understanding of the system of justifications in criminal law. The solution to the dilemma lies in a prior analysis of the legal positions of all agents involved in the conflict, from a perspective of the principles of autonomy and solidarity as the core of the system of justifications.",

title={Autonomous Vehicle Ethics: Stock or custom?},
year={2017},
volume={6},
number={3},
pages={108-110},
abstract={A current challenge in the development of autonomous vehicles is programming the ethics of their behavior. One way to explore ethical issues of safety and agency when an autonomous vehicle is put in a situation where it must choose between two outcomes has been to use the trolley problem, a moral dilemma documented by Prof. J.J. Thompson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [1]. In the trolley problem, a moral dilemma is presented: is it preferable to kill one person to save the lives of five others, or to do nothing, even if one knows that five people would die? The trolley problem suggests two scenarios: 1) a person is driving a trolley without functioning brakes that is about to hit five people working on a track and must decide if he will steer the train down another track and just kill one workman, or 2) a person is a bystander, in similar circumstances, and must decide if he will pull a switch to kill one person working on the track, instead of the five people. As it turns out, Thompson declares that "most people" believe it is acceptable to divert a train away from killing five people, to kill only one, but in a variation involving pushing someone onto the track to stop the trolley, most people believe that it "would not be morally permissible for you to proceed, even if this would save five lives".},
